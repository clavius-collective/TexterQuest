<!ELEMENT user_hash (#PCDATA)>
<!-- Some form of UUID to identify players internally. -->

<!ELEMENT user_name (#PCDATA)>
<!-- A more human-readable sort of thing. -->

<!ELEMENT actor_list (actor_hash)*>
<!-- Actor hashes are only used because the actors will probably be stored in --
  -- other files, but hashes can be used to identify which files to  load. --
  -- Potentially the filesystem will also be used for this; restricting players --
  -- to their personal folders to try to maintain a level of security. -->

<!ELEMENT preference (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST preference type CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!-- For now, preference type will be CDATA, with code to handle malformed --
  -- preferences. -->
