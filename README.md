TexterQuest
===========

A textual game engine with a goal of being a multi-user dungeon setup.

The source is now being converted to use Emacs's change log functionality. To
update the change log entry for a file, use C-x 4 a. Each directory has a
ChangeLog file; make sure that the file is added to the repository for a new
directory. C-x 4 a will create ChangeLog if none exists yet.
