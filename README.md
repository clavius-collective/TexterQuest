TexterQuest
===========

A textual game engine with a goal of being a multi-user dungeon setup.

This game also requires
[libPXP](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/pxp.html), the Polymorphic XML
Parser, to work with stored files. As of January 2013, the PXP 1.2.3 tarball is
included in the folder to provide easy access to this package; PXP's copyright
belongs to its authors, and its provision here follows its licensing.
